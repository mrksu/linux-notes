= Linux Notes

These are some of my personal notes that help me when installing Linux. They're great for me to:

- Copy commands syntax
- Copy lists of packages to paste into the package manager
- Remember to do all the stuff I like to do
- Keep track of various config files and tuning parameters

Originally, they made little sense to anyone but me. Currently, I'm trying to rewrite them to be more accessible and structured. Not guaranteed to be comprehensible at all times.

// This is the recommended way to link relative adoc files, but it doesn't work well with GitLab's previews. Maybe revisit it after we do proper adoc building.
// The <<single-page.adoc#linux-notes-single-page,single-page>> variant compiled from all chapters
// This isn't recommended, but works for my use case.
// The link:single-page.adoc[single-page] variant compiled from all chapters

// TODO: Add a 'Handy References' file.

These are the "`chapters`" currently available:

- link:chapters/packages.adoc[Useful Packages]: lists of some packages for Fedora and Debian to quickly copy and paste
- link:chapters/system-tuning.adoc[System Tuning]: tweaking at the lower level
- link:chapters/gnome.adoc[Gnome]: getting the most out of Gnome and its applications
- link:chapters/applications.adoc[Applications Tuning]: notes related to other applications
- link:chapters/fonts.adoc[Some Free Fonts]: pretty fonts released under a free license; for the Linux user who has everything
